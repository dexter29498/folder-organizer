# Folder Organizer

## About

A utility tool to organize the messy folders like Downloads. This tool scans a
specified directory, categorizes the files based on their types (e.g.,
documents, images, videos, archives), and moves them into neatly organized
subfolders on running.

## How to Use

1. Download the latest executable file for your respective operating system
   from [here](https://github.com/dexter29498/folder-organizer/releases).

2. Move it to the folder you want to organize.

3. Run the file by double-clicking it.

    - For linux if it doesn't run due to permission issue then run below command
      ```bash
      chmod +x <file_name>
      ```

    - For linux to see script output, run it from terminal,
      ```bash
      ./<file_name>
      ```

**NOTES:**

- You can also rename the file to whatever name you like. It will still work.
- You can copy to different folder as well. No need to download again.
